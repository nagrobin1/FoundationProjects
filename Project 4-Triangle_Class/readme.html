<!--{{ Synopsis-->

<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
<p>For this project, you are asked to implement part of a simple triangle class, and write a function that will search for right triangles<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> with certain properties. It should be a simple project, and is mainly designed to give you a breather and to reinforce what we have covered. However, there are a few new things that we'll introduce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working with multiple files (separating the implementation from the interface).</li>
<li>Making your own datatypes via <code>class</code> constructs.</li>
<li>A bit about <em>arrays</em> in C++.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also look forward to learning more about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic C++ data structures like <code>&lt;vector&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Functions and arguments.</li>
<li>The technique of &quot;exhaustive search&quot; (a.k.a., &quot;brute force&quot;).</li>
<li>Datatypes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="recommended-reading">Recommended Reading</h3>
<p>Most of the new concepts you'll need are covered in chapter 9 of the book. You can also read <a href="http://www.charlesli.org/pic10a/lectures/lecture17/index.html">Professor Li's Notes</a> on structs (which are essentially the same as classes), and <a href="http://www.charlesli.org/pic10a/lectures/lecture12/index.html">Professor Li's Notes</a> on arrays.</p>

<h2 id="important-notes-on-grading">Important Notes on Grading</h2>
<p>As always,</p>
<ul>
<li>Code that does not compile will receive a 0.</li>
<li>Files that are not properly named will receive a 0. (See the section below on &quot;what to submit.&quot;)</li>
<li>I will try to make my test programs as flexible as possible, but <strong>please run the test script</strong> and make sure everything matches. This will save both of us a good bit of time and irritation :D</li>
<li>SUBMIT SOMETHING! Even if it doesn't pass all tests. I can't provide partial credit if I don't receive any code.</li>

<!--{{ Details-->

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>Your job is very simple: just write the following four functions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>findRightTriangles</code></li>
<li><code>area</code></li>
<li><code>congruent</code></li>
<li><code>similar</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Details follow:</p>
<h3 id="vectortriangle-findrighttrianglesunsigned-long-l-unsigned-long-h"><code>vector&lt;triangle&gt; findRightTriangles(unsigned long l, unsigned long h)</code></h3>
<p>This function searches for <em>right triangles</em> satisfying certain conditions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>All the side lengths must be <strong>integers</strong></li>
<li>The triangles must be <strong>right triangles</strong></li>
<li>The perimeter must be <strong>bounded</strong> above and below by input parameters; that is, <span class="math"><em>l</em> ≤ perimeter ≤ <em>h</em></span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>findRightTriangles</code> function should return a <code>vector</code> of triangles which satisfy the above requirements (right, integer sides), such that the perimeter <span class="math"><em>p</em></span> satisfies <span class="math"><em>l</em> ≤ <em>p</em> ≤ <em>h</em></span>.</p>
<h3 id="unsigned-long-trianglearea"><code>unsigned long triangle::area()</code></h3>
<p>This function simply computes the area of the triangle. <em>Note:</em> that you can assume <code>area</code> will only be called for right triangles with integer sides. <em>Note:</em> this is a <em>member function</em> of the triangle class, which is why there is no input parameter.</p>
<h3 id="bool-congruent...-and-similar..."><code>bool congruent(...)</code> and <code>similar(...)</code></h3>
<p>These last two return whether or not the two input triangles are congruent and similar, respectively. (In case you have forgotten what these terms mean, go look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_%28geometry%29">wikipedia</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="aside-const-by-reference-parameters">Aside: <code>const</code> by reference parameters</h3>
<p>Note the use of the <code>const</code> keyword in the last two functions. Testing for congruence or similarity probably should <strong>not</strong> result in the parameters being modified, so it seems like by-value is what we want. However, passing a structure <em>by reference</em> is <em>more efficient</em> than by value, and we wouldn't want to miss out on that. So what to do? The idea is to use a <code>const</code> by-reference parameter. In this way, we kind of &quot;fake&quot; a by-value call. The <code>const</code> keyword ensures that the parameters won't be changed by the function (unless someone goes way out of their way). <em>Exercise:</em> When you are writing the last two functions, try to modify <code>t1</code> or <code>t2</code> somewhere in the function definition, and see what the compiler tells you.</p>
<p>You should also write something in <code>trianglesMain.cpp</code> for your own testing and debugging, but strictly speaking, this isn't necessary.</p>
<p>As was mentioned, there isn't a lot of work to do for this project. <strong>That doesn't mean you should procrastinate.</strong> Start early, and take some time to absorb the few new ideas we are introducing. In particular:</p>
<h3 id="what-to-watch-for">What to watch for</h3>
<p><strong>Classes:</strong> We'll be using a class to store triangle data. You have already had some experience with classes, e.g., <code>string</code> and <code>set</code> and <code>vector</code>. But now for the first time, you are seeing <em>how to write your own</em>. This will hopefully generate lots of questions.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple files:</strong> the project is now separated into a header file, an implementation file, and a main program. The header file describes <em>what</em> the various parts of the program do, while the implementation describes <em>how</em> they do it. Again, this should be generating questions. Perhaps you are thinking &quot;Why would anyone want to do this?&quot; or &quot;Isn't it just making things more complicated?&quot; See if you can find answers.</p>
<p>Now would be an excellent time to go back and review the <a href="http://ccvcl.org/~molina/S15-cs103/commandline.html">compiling on the command line tutorial</a>. Also, go back and re-read page 48 of the book. Now that you have multiple files, this stuff should start to make a lot more sense. You have to separately compile <code>triangles.cpp</code> and the main program's file, and then link the results together into an executable. I have given you a makefile to do this (see below) but before you use it, do it by hand, with your book sitting next to you, open to page 48.</p>
<p><strong>There are two <code>main()</code> functions:</strong> One of them is for you to do your own debugging (<code>trianglesMain.cpp</code>). The other (<code>main.cpp</code>) is to run a test script. I gave you a makefile to manage this. Here's a quick summary of how to use it:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$ make</code> will compile and link <code>trianglesMain.cpp</code> to produce an executable called <code>triangleTest</code>. Currently, <code>trianglesMain.cpp</code> is pretty empty. It is for you to write your own test code.</li>
<li><code>$ make main</code> will compile and link <code>main.cpp</code>, the test script (see the testing section below) and produce an executable called <code>triangles</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> Eclipse will complicate things a bit, because it makes its own makefiles. If you try to add all of this to an eclipse project and hit &quot;build&quot;, it will probably (definitely) fail. You will need to take the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Add a new build configuration go to &quot;project, manage configurations, new..&quot; and copy the settings from debug. Call this new one &quot;testing&quot;. It will be for the <code>main.cpp</code> test program I gave you.</li>
<li>Now go back to the workspace panel (on the left, that shows the files of your project) and right click the <code>main.cpp</code> file. Select &quot;resource configuration, exclude from build&quot; and then select &quot;Debug&quot; (you will not be using this file for the debug target).</li>
<li>Now do the same thing as above for <code>trianglesMain.cpp</code>, but exclude it from &quot;testing&quot;, and leave it in &quot;debug&quot;.</li>
<li>You're all set now. The debug configuration will build <code>trianglesMain.cpp</code>, and the testing configuration will build <code>main.cpp</code>. You can switch between the two via &quot;project, build configurations, set active&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="other-exercises">Other exercises</h3>
<p>You should also try the following while you are programming.</p>
<p><em>Operators:</em> If you have two <code>triangle</code> instances, you can compare them for equality as follows:</p>
<table class="sourceCode cpp numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode cpp">triangle t1(<span class="dv">3</span>,<span class="dv">4</span>,<span class="dv">5</span>);
triangle t2(<span class="dv">5</span>,<span class="dv">4</span>,<span class="dv">3</span>);

cout &lt;&lt; (t1 == t2) &lt;&lt; endl;</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>The above code would output <code>0</code> meaning that the two are not equal. However, using congruence might be a more sensible definition of equality. As it turns out, you can tell C++ to change its definition of equality if you want. This is done by defining <code>operator==(...)</code> for triangles. Read more of chapter 9 regarding operators for details, and if you want, try to write such a function inside of <code>trianglesMain.cpp</code>.</p>
<p><em>Complexity:</em> Look at your code for <code>findRightTriangles</code>. Think carefully about the sequence of steps it goes through to compute the answer. Supposing you call the function with the lower bound <code>l=1</code>, how much time does your algorithm take in terms of the other parameter <code>h</code>? I.e., can you find a polynomial expression <span class="math"><em>T</em>(<em>h</em>)</span> that models how many statements must be executed in order to compute the answer? The expression doesn't have to be very precise -- see if you can just figure out the <em>degree</em> of the polynomial.</p>
<!--}}-->

<!--{{ Testing-->

<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>This program is a little more complicated to test than the ones before it, but I know you can handle it : ) To test, just compile <code>main.cpp</code>, say with <code>$ make main</code>, and run the resulting <code>triangles</code> executable. Check the output of that with the <code>soutput</code> file that I have distributed. If you want, you can do this:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">make</span> main
$ <span class="kw">gvimdiff</span> -f <span class="kw">&lt;(./triangles)</span> soutput</code></pre>
<p>If there are no differences, rejoice. Otherwise, see if you can figure out what went wrong. For this, it might be helpful to not redirect the output to a file, and just run:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">make</span> main
$ <span class="kw">./triangles</span></code></pre>
<p>This should show you what tests are running with your output right under it. You can then find what you should have had by examining the diff.</p>
<h3 id="hints">Hints</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>findRightTriangles</code>: For this, there are formulas that will compute the integers you are after, but it might be easier to just use a brute-force approach. Construct a loop (perhaps nested loops) that runs over all the possibilities, and then filter out everything but the ones that match. I won't test the program on really large integers, so don't be too concerned over performance. Just get the right answers.</li>
<li>Everything else: <code>area</code>,<code>congruent</code>,<code>similar</code>: The formulas are easy for figuring these out, but there is one kind of sticky point: you have no guarantees about the ordering of the edges. The easiest thing to do is put them in order first, and then do the comparisons / computations. For this, you can use the <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/sort/"><code>sort()</code> function</a> from the <code>algorithm</code> library. Here's an example:</li>
</ul>
<table class="sourceCode cpp numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span class="ot">#include &lt;algorithm&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">using</span> std::sort;
<span class="dt">bool</span> triangle::area() {
    <span class="co">// put the sides in an array:</span>
    <span class="dt">unsigned</span> <span class="dt">long</span> sides[<span class="dv">3</span>] = {s1,s2,s3};
    <span class="co">// sort the array:</span>
    sort(sides,sides<span class="dv">+3</span>);
    <span class="co">// at this point, sides[0] &lt;= sides[1] &lt;= sides[2]</span>
}</code></pre></td></tr></table>
